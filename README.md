# linear-regression
Website with Simple Linear Regression implementation.

Made a script which shows median line for entered points and as always created a blog post for it.
I decided that there are no users on GitHub with old browsers, so the whole thing works only in ES6.
I am sorry if something won't work for you because of this reason.
